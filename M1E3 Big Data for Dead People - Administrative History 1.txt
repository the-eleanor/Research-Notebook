Details about Sarah's court case and other late 19th c British court cases

-She claimed to have found two banknotes on the ground, which had actually been stolen from the briefcase of Sydney Tomlin
-We know her punishment was that she was sent to Wandsworth Gaol for two years of hard labour as punishment
-Turned in by Ms. Seyfert, a drunk whom Sarah had refused to give a handout to
-The Old Bailey was where many defendants were brought to trial in 19th c England, and had been a place for this for over 200 years
-Sarah's case can be located during a time where the justice system was evolving and many backroom deals between police and legal officials were taking place
-A detective was mentioned in the case, slightly unusual
-The new policing and court system was difficult for Sarah to understand
-Plead guilty at her trial, asking to return the two banknotes instead of being punished for 10 years
	-Got two years' punishment instead
-Signifies the change in court proceedings in which the state imposed its will on the individual
	-This would also have been more difficult for the poor and the old to navigate
	-The system would also have led to a higher conviction rate
-As a result, Sarah's conviction was almost inevitable
-At the time, cases involving theft (especially cases of women) had a much higher conviction rate than those of more violent crimes such as murder
