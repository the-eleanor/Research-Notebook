M2E3 APIs - March 17, 2016

This exercise was certainly an experience.

First of all, I was a little frustrated with how unclear the instructions were about what each downloaded program or application did - it was confusing to see which things I needed and which I did not, and I ended up with some redundancies and missing parts the first time I tried to harvest all the Canadiana entries.

I did end up asking for advice on Slack regarding downloading some of the necessary files from SourceForge, since I had heard bad things about its reputation for including junkware in its downloads. I also consulted my best friend (and honestly, my personal tech support), who is not in this course but is a computer science major. She told me that as long as I kept an eye on what it was installing, it would be alright, so that is what I did because I wasn't sure where the alternative download location Professor Graham had mentioned was.

It took a bit of trial and error, since at first both jq and wget were causing the program to turn up with errors. Eventually I figured out why things were misbehaving; I am on Windows 10 so I had to make sure the "./" came before "jq" in the "canadiana.sh" file, and I had forgotten to change the name from "wget64" to just "wget." 

Finally, it ran successfully, and I just used the "splitthingsup.sh" command included with the folder. Then it plunked over 32 000 files into the same folder because I hadn't set up the folders correctly, and then I was grumpy. My computer was clearly not thrilled when I got it to move all of them into a new folder.

Anyway, I will probably look into different ways to split up the information next time I go through this process, because I am not really a fan of the formatting of the content format of the resulting split files.

But I finished it and now I am going to take some deep breaths.

The files were GIGANTIC and GitHub couldn't handle them, so I took screenshots.
