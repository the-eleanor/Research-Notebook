M1E1 Markdown Exercise - February 21, 2016

Initially, I had been interested in this class under the assumption that we would be examining the history of technology. I suppose I was wrong, but the contents of the course still appeal to me and seem useful to me. I am hoping to attend Algonquin College's [Applied Museum Studies program](http://www.algonquincollege.com/healthandcommunity/program/applied-museum-studies/) once I complete my BA in History, and I feel that understanding modern and digital research methods would be very helpful and relevant in this pursuit.

I would say that I do have some background with digital experiences. My parents both work with computers for a living and they have instilled computer literacy into me from a young age. I am not so knowledgeable as my best friend, who is studying Computer Science at another university, but I am capable and always willing to learn more. I also attended the [Virtual Ventures summer camp](http://carleton.ca/vv/) at Carleton from the summer of 2002 to the summer of 2011. I was a camper for most of those years, but gained my high school volunteer hours as a volunteer during the last three summers. We learned basic HTML as well as how to use a multitude of creative programs for projects such as music, animation, and game-making. I also built my own computer with my dad (and the help of a few [useful websites](http://www.logicalincrements.com/)) last summer, which was an exciting and educational experience!

While the course feels a little bit overwhelming right now, I am sure I will be able to understand it as time goes on. I am looking forward to learning how to use new digital tools in this course, and especially curious as to how these might aid in the study of history. I think digital media have shown themselves to be useful in presenting and studying history, and I already follow some sites and blogs that look at historical narratives, such as [Rejected Princesses](http://www.rejectedprincesses.com/). My goal in this course is to be able to use the tools available to me in our digital world to better my understanding of history and my research methods. I am intrigued by the emphasis on methods and software that I might normally associate with the Computer Science field, and I hope that I will be able to follow along and improve my understanding of the topics and concepts covered by the course.
