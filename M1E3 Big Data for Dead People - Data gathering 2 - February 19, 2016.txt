Case specifics

-Using digital tools, Sarah's language can be extracted from the records and used to determine the language of other women of her class and age
-Documents can also be used to locate her and who she lived with and around, and this can be compiled to create a better picture of her life
-The words used and the events of the case can use tools such as Google Books to determine how usual or unusual her court case was
-Compiling the data from a vast number of other cases, using factors such as length, sentence, and crime, and plugging it into a graph can reveal yet more about her case
	-It locates her in a time where conviction rates were rising
-Data can also be used to determine the relationship between trial text and trial outcome;  ie evidence gathered as it relates to court proceedings; as well as semantics
-A soundscape of the courtroom can be created, in order to yield yet more information (such as what it would feel like to be there) about contemporary court cases
