M1E3 Big Data for Dead People - Data gathering 1

Digital history as a field

-Tools like Google Books and the Ngram Viewer can yield information regarding word usage and historical contexts
-Digital data analysis tends to yield similar information compared to books due to books being a much older technology
-Using other media, not just literary works, can provide a more accurate history of people from all walks of life, and technology can help us understand this
-XML can be used to create associations in the data
-Digital tools can be used to create graphs that can show trends and locate specific events in their historical context, using a vast amount of sources condensed into the graph

-”Reading text – close, distant, computationally, or immersively - is the vanilla sex of the digital humanities and digital history” - literally the worst metaphor I've read in my academic life due to the negative use of “vanilla sex” being an implication that certain sexual preferences are somehow to be shamed

-Digital tools can also help provide the information needed to recreate other parts of an event, such as the sound, sight, or feel.
-Digital research can mirror traditional book research, albeit with some shortcuts that technology provides
-These tools can be used to create historical maps of places
-Concern that our questions and goals as historians are being shaped by technology, not the other way around
