M4E2 and E4 - April 1, 2016

The Topic Modeling Tool was actually a fairly simple thing to use - following the instructions, I had no problems at all with getting it to carry out its job. The results are a little bit confusing, as instead of displaying one word for each item on the output list, it provides a string of terms and words, some of which seem to be related and some of which...I'm not so sure about.

Still, though, it definitely creates a way to provide areas of focus within the database, and I am actually happy it exists because I can see it being very useful with the database I've chosen for my final project.

Here are the topic results in a list format: https://github.com/the-eleanor/Module-4-Exercises/blob/master/M4E2%20-%20Topic%20Modeling%20Tool%20exercise%20results%20-%20March%2023%202016%20-%20Topics.csv

I also decided to try to use Overview for text analysis. Unfortunately, I did not experience as much success with it. I did reach out to the Slack space to figure out how to get it to provide me with more filtered results as the instructions requested, but frankly, I still couldn't figure out a way to use it efficiently and effectively. The multisearch tool seemed like it would be difficult to use if you had a lot of words to weed out, making the word cloud the only useful way to edit out unwanted words. I can see how it might be useful in figuring out what words are most prominent in a dataset, and dealing with large amounts of documents and their important key words, but I may have to spend more time figuring it out to make it an effective tool for my final project.

When removing words in the word cloud, I focused on removing common words and numbers, because they would not be much use to research. I did try to leave words that had to do with measurement of time, as they might prove useful (especially in creating a timeline) depending on what one is looking for in the data. I also kept verbs such as "took" and "make" because they may be useful in depicting experiences of the peoples discussed in the pieces.

Here is the screenshot of my work in Overview, especially the word cloud: https://github.com/the-eleanor/Module-4-Exercises/blob/master/M4E4%20-%20Overview%20exercise%20-%20April%201%202016%20-%20Screenshot%20of%20results.png
