Sarah Durrant

-”Not important” (Rude!)
-Ran a coffeehouse in the 1870's
-Physical details such as moles on her face are readily available through documents that include information on her, mostly from court documents
-Found two banknotes on the ground 
-Sent to Wandsworth Gaol for two years of hard labour as punishment
-Working class woman in her 60's
-Used the Anglican calendar, which by 1871 was becoming less common, but she would have used it in her childhood
	-Frequently used older language patterns of her youth
-A little uncertain about her age
-Lived at No. 1 London Road
-Brought to trial at the Old Bailey
-Plead guilty at her trial, asking to return the two banknotes instead of being punished for 10 years
	-Got two years' punishment instead
-Her conviction was almost inevitable due to the evolving justice system which put more pwoer in the state than the individual and was harder for older and poorer folk to navigate
-Digital history can be used to examine something as close as her moles, and also determine something as large as her place in the history of court proceedings in 19th c England
